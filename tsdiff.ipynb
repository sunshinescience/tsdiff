    "I like the idea of comparing curvature as a function of arc length for the different curves having the same total arc length. This function is easily constructed for any smooth curve described by parametric equations. But this is only useful if \"similar shapes\" is defined so that similarity is not affected by rotation or displacement. For example, two straight line segments of the same length have exactly the same shape regardless of location or rotational orientation. A quantitative measure of dis-similarities between two curve shapes is any quantitative measure of the error between the two functions of curvature as a function of arc length. Possible examples are the max-norm error, or a root-mean-square error, etc. The selection of this latter error measure would be part of the definition of the measure of dis-similarities between two curve shapes."

    "I like the suggested by tests via some functionals. Why should one check  the best fit if there is no chance seen sometimes 'from the first glance'? One remark: the choice of the functionals requires having them shape invariant. With respect to this, the idea of starting with the piecewise linear functions suggested by  Biswanath and Robert's idea of using splines (see link above) of a determined kind (say, degree and smoothness) with the same number of knots seems to be very appropriate for comparing functions of a single variable in a bounded interval. I think this way can be extended to multidimensional domain (say, surfaces), and even to closed curves through some Bezier approximation.  The value of Robert's note is that one should start with rough estimates for getting less expensive chance of discovering the lack of similarity.\n",

No problem if both curves are known only on discrete sets of x's, even if both x-sets do not coincide - just interpolate the y-value of the second curve (or use second curve's point nearest in t).  Collect all pairs (yj(first), yj(second)).  When sampling points for both curves do not coincide (in t), repeat the travel, this time along the second curve.
